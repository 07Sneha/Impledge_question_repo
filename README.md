<B>Data structure Used :<B>
To store all inputs in dictionary type structure I use trie data structure so that I can get to know about words which are the part of current word
Approach of finding longest:
Read Input from file.
Make Trie data structure and insert words in Trie
Keeping the track of Longest and second longest word.
then we are iterating over each input word and checking whether current word can be formed by concatening the other words of given input or not
Approach of finding time elapse:
using inbuilt function of java currentTimeMillis() which give current execution time then by using this function in starting and in ending we can find out the time gap which result total execution time of our project.
